# QSAR biodegradation
Classification and prediction of biodegradable or non-biodegradable compounds using QSAR data.
## Motivation
 The objective of this project is to leverage QSAR-Data (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) derived from chemical compounds to classify substances as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Given that degrading compounds may take an extensive amount of time for decomposition, traditional degradability experiments can be time-consuming. This is where the QSAR approach demonstrates its effectiveness. By examining readily obtainable molecular properties, we can estimate the behavior of molecules, specifically their biodegradability. This estimation offers a swift and cost-effective alternative to time-intensive experiments, facilitating proper chemical disposal practices. In doing so, this project contributes to environmental preservation, ensuring responsible chemical management and minimizing the need for expensive long-term experiments.

 In this project we will carry out several steps from our dataset :
 * Data pre-processing with the import of libraries, the cleaning of the dataframe, and normalization
 * Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn to show the degradable or non-degradable behavior of the compounds
 * Modeling with the exploration of multiple classification models like logistic regression and KNN
 ## Dataset
 Dataset used : QSAR biodegradation

 Data set containing values for 41 attributes (molecular descriptors) used to classify 1055 chemicals into 2 classes (ready and not ready biodegradable).
 The data have been used to develop QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) models for the study of the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules.
